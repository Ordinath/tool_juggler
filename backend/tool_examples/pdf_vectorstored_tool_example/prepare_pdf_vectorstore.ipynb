ChatGPT is able to respond effectively to a wide range\\nof human questions, providing ﬂuent and comprehensive answers that signiﬁcantly\\nsurpass previous public chatbots in terms of security and usefulness. On one hand,\\npeople are curious about how ChatGPT is able to achieve such strength and how\\nfar it is from human experts. On the other hand, people are starting to worry about\\nthe potential negative impacts that large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT\\ncould have on society, such as fake news, plagiarism, and social security issues.\\nIn this work, we collected tens of thousands of comparison responses from both\\nhuman experts and ChatGPT, with questions ranging from open-domain, ﬁnancial,\\nmedical, legal, and psychological areas. We call the collected dataset the Human\\nChatGPT Comparison Corpus ( HC3 ). Based on the HC3 dataset, we study the\\ncharacteristics of ChatGPT’s responses, the differences and gaps from human\\nexperts, and future directions for LLMs. We conducted comprehensive human\\nevaluations and linguistic analyses of ChatGPT-generated content compared with\\nthat of humans, where many interesting results are revealed. After that, we conduct\\nextensive experiments on how to effectively detect whether a certain text is gener-\\nated by ChatGPT or humans. We build three different detection systems, explore\\nseveral key factors that inﬂuence their effectiveness, and evaluate them in differ-\\nent scenarios. The dataset, code, and models are all publicly available at https:\\n//github.com/Hello-SimpleAI/chatgpt-comparison-detection .\\n1 Introduction\\nSince its dazzling debut in November 2022, OpenAI’s ChatGPT has gained huge attention and wide\\ndiscussion in the natural language processing (NLP) community and many other ﬁelds. According\\nto OpenAI, ChatGPT is ﬁne-tuned from the GPT-3.5 series with Reinforcement Learning from\\nHuman Feedback (RLHF; [ 7,32]), using nearly the same methods as InstructGPT [ 25], but with\\nslight differences in the data collection setup. The vast amount of knowledge in GPT-3.5 and the\\nmeticulous ﬁne-tuning based on human feedback enable ChatGPT to excel at many challenging NLP\\n\\x03Equal Contribution.\\nyProject Lead.
